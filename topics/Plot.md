The wealthy Rose family—video store magnate Johnny (Eugene Levy), his wife and former soap opera actress Moira (Catherine O'Hara), and their pampered adult children David (Dan Levy) and Alexis (Annie Murphy)—lose their fortune after being defrauded by their business manager. They rebuild their lives with their sole remaining asset: a small town named Schitt's Creek, which Johnny bought for David as a joke birthday gift in 1991.[5] The Roses relocate to Schitt's Creek, moving into two adjacent rooms in a run-down motel. While the family adjusts to their new lives, their well-to-do attitudes come into conflict with the more provincial residents of Schitt's Creek, including mayor Roland Schitt (Chris Elliott), his wife Jocelyn (Jenn Robertson), the motel's manager Stevie Budd (Emily Hampshire), town council elects Ronnie (Karen Robinson) and Bob (John Hemphill), and Jazzagal member and Café Tropical waitress Twyla Sands (Sarah Levy).[5]
